# Apps-Rating-Review-System
Microservices Project : Apps rating/review system using Spring boot

## Idea
Inspired by Google Playâ€™s comprehensive rating and feedback mechanism.

Collect and manage user-generated ratings and reviews for applications.

Develop system that is
  1. Scalable
  2. Maintainable
  3. Handles large volume of data and user interactions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Create microservice 
- Microservice Communication
- Service Discovery/Registry 
- API Gateway

## Microservices
1. User Service : stores details of users who will give rating/review
2. App Service : stores details of all available apps in web store
3. Rating Service : stores information of rating/review given by user
4. Service Registry : keeps track of all available service instances
5. API Gateway : acts as centralised entrypoint to client requests for different services.
